# React map practice - small exercises

## Setup

-   create a new repo based on this one (use this template)
-   clone your new repo
-   run `yarn` to install dependencies
-   run `yarn dev` to start the local dev server running
-   pay attention to any errors in terminal and in browser's console

## Notes

-   you don't need to write any css. Match the requested structure and classes specified in the following tasks and your elements will be styled by existing CSS.

## Task 1

Edit the file `src/MapPractice1.jsx`

Starting with the array of objects returned by useEmojiGenerator(), create and return HTML elements matching the expected output found in [expected1.html](/public/expected1.html)

-   pay attention to the structure and the classes assigned to each element.
-   remember to use `classList` in React in order to have it generate the `class` attribute in HTML.
-   It doesn't matter which emojis are in your list - these are generated at random!

## Task 2

Edit the file `src/MapPractice2.jsx`

Starting with the array of objects returned by useMovieGenerator(), create and return HTML elements matching the expected output found in [expected2.html](/public/expected2.html)

-   pay attention to the structure and the classes assigned to each element.
-   remember to use `classList` in React in order to have it generate the `class` attribute in HTML.
-   It doesn't matter which movies are in your list - these are generated at random!
